# Face Antispoofing dataset for recognition systems

The dataset consists of **98,000** videos and selfies from **170** countries, providing a foundation for developing robust **security systems** and **facial recognition algorithms.**

While the dataset itself doesn't contain spoofing attacks, it's a valuable resource for testing **liveness detection system**, allowing researchers to simulate attacks and evaluate how effectively their systems can distinguish between real faces and various forms of spoofing.

By utilizing this dataset, researchers can contribute to the development of advanced security solutions, enabling the safe and reliable use of biometric technologies for **authentication and verification**. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/face-anti-spoofing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=face-anti-spoofing)**
